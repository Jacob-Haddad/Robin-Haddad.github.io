						<h2>Developing as a Professional Educator</h2>

					<h1><font color="purple">Describe a professional goal you have for yourself.</font></h1>
					<p><big><font color="green"> A professional goal I have for myself is to create more opportunities in the coming years to teach my passion, Science, to my middle school students. Working for an online program and only teaching in person once a week and once a week online did not enable me to teach my passion as much as I would have liked.</font></big></p>
					<h1><font color="purple">Why have you identified this as a need or interest?</font></h1>
					<p><big><font color="green">Not only is Science my passion, it has come under attack in recent years throughout our country’s educational system at the hands of politicians who would love nothing more than to plunge us back into the “Dark Ages”. The denial of facts relating to evolution, and climate change, due to man- made activity, scares me. I am a firm believer in the First Amendment and Thomas Jefferson’s description of its intent, “Separation of church and state”. I feel we are at critical juncture in our country’s history both socially and environmentally, and we need to act now, not later. Some scientists believe that we have already reached the tipping point, but I cannot give up hope. I must continue to try and affect change by lighting the flames of passion in my students to take Science and our planet’s survival seriously.</font></big></p>
